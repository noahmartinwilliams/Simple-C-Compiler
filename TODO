Optimizations:
	*multiplication by two might be better with left shifting.
	*for (;;) { break; } should be ignored (except for if there's a label after the break).
	*do whole program optimizing at link time.

Parser ideas:
	*make it possible to get a list of functions, types, and global variables.
	*make it possible to change the name of the attribute accessed for every instance of a given structure.

*Start labeling the versions of this thing.
*operators to add:
	char* assign(struct expr_t *dest, struct expr_t *src)
	*always eval src first.
	*returns thing to put in movl %s, %s where first %s is expression value, and second is returned by assign
	*rax should be pointer to place to put thing
